# SPS_NOV15_HowTo
In case there is a problem with the beam call 77500. 
If there are problems with the telescope / DAQ, call G. Auzinger
## INFRASTRUCTURE

This section briefly describes how to start the DAQ of the EUDET Telescope / TLU / FEI4 plane.
### go to the AIDA Telescope control PC
1) navigate in the eudaq/ directory and execute the STARTRUN.cmstk script

        ./STARTRUN.cmstk

this Kills all previous instance of the  EUDAQ runcontrol start the runcontrol and the EUDAQ log & data collector and the online Monitor + brings up the GUI 
once you start, be sure to use the "cms_Nov15_internal/external" configuration file

2) on the AIDA Telescope Control PC, open the Remote Desktop client 

there are 2 PCs: NICratePC & USBPixPC1, you will need RDC connections to both:
    
2a) connect to the NICrate PC, go to C:\opt\eudaq\bin and start the

    startNIandTLU.bat

this will bring up two command line windows, one for the NI Producer (Telescope Data) and one for the TLU (trigger handling).

Furthermore, in the runcontrol window on the AIDA control PC, you will see that the NIProducer & TLU producer have connected to the run control.

2b) connect to the USBPixPC1 and start the STProducer by clicking the icon on the Desktop (Start_STControl....)

then you will see the USBpix producer connect in the main RunControl window.

3) Now om the AIDA Telescope PC go the EUDAQ run control GUI and load the correct config file :

        cms_Nov15_internal/external.conf

This file contains all necessary settings for: Mimosa telescope, FEI4 plane & TLU. Be aware that the filename without the ".conf" has to be copied in the "Config" field. cms_Nov15_internal.conf is for running with internal triggers, _ext is for the scintillator trigger.

8) click "Config". This configures TLU and Telescope - be aware that there is significant lag in the remote connection so be patient and click only once! If you click twice, there is a chance you will have to start the whole procedure again.

4) During the run monitor the errors of the RunControlLog & OnlineMonitor



## Starting a Telescope Run

1) navigate to the EUDAQ run control & click "Start". This starts a run, issues a run number and gets the TLU ready. Also, be patient and click only once. As soon as the scaler and particle counters are 0 the run starts and you have a run number (you can get it also from the LOG collector)

NOTE: The TLU will not issue any triggers before the GLIB DAQ is started!

2) after a run is finished, click Stop on the EUDAQ run control. Be patient and click only once!

2a) if you want to immediately start the next run, wait a bit (see the log collector) and click "Start" again!


## Configuring the GLIB, CBCs etc

Our DAQ is controlled by 2 XDAQ applications that run on cmsuptracker008:
    -) GlibSupervisor (for control and configuration)
    -) GlibStreamer (for data readout)

0) As a first step, log into the control Pc and ssh to cmsuptracker008 (in the beam area). 

    ssh -XY xtaldaq@cmsuptracker008

once logged in, you can start GlibStreamer/Supervisor by calling a shell script:

        /home/xtaldaq/CBCDAQ/GlibStreamer/scripts glibConnect.sh 16

(be sure to put the option 16 after the script, otherwise you will have the wrong config)

then, in a browser (on your local PC), the XDAQ main page can be reached on cmsuptracker008 on port 13000

        cmsuptracker008:13000

this brings you the the hyperdaq page where you will have icons both for the GLIBStreamer & the GLIB Supervisor. Open both in new Tabs.

1) first go to the GLIBSupervisor, click initialize, wait for the state-change and then click configure.
2) on the GlibStreamer page, select "Load Parameters from file" and put the following file in the box:
    
    /home/xtaldaq/streamerValues.txt

click "LoadfromFile". This will update the settings and put the correct values in the fields. All you have to do is update the run number to the one you derive from the ELOG (cmstkph2-bt.web.cern.ch). After you have done so, click configure. 

In the fields labelled "Destination file" and "New DAQ format file" enter the following filepath / name:

        Destination file: /cmsuptrackernas/Raw/runxxx.raw
        New DAQ format file: /cmsuptrackernas/DaqData/runxxx.daq

where xxx is the run number from the ELOG (make sure to fill the TLU run number from the EUDAQ run control in the appropriate field).

(old text: Then, in the "Number of Acquisitions" field enter the number of events you would like to record / 1000. (i.e. 400 for 400k Events - the default packet size for our DAQ is 999 which is 1000 in reality as it is zero-indexed).

Click the "Conditions Data" field and fill the fields for HighVoltage, Angle and in the third, enter the current threshold in decimal, then click OK. 

Now the GlibStreamer is configured correctly.)

Eventually, depending on the run type, you might also have to change the number of acquisitions (multiply this number by 1000 and you get the number of events that will be recorded).

**Make sure that the "Break Trigger during block read" is not ticked!**

now go to conditions data and enter the data following the list in the AIDA counting room. 

2) before you can start a run, you need to configure the GLIB readout board and the CBC chips on the module. This could be done with the GLIBSupervisor application running in another tab but it is rather cumbersome and involves a lot of clicking. It is much easier to do the following.

-) open another terminal and 

    ssh -XY xtaldaq@cmsuptracker008

once logged in:

    cd Ph2_ACF
    source setup.sh

If you have to modify settings other than the Threshold (VCth), open the file

        ~/Ph2_ACF/settings/Beamtest_Nov15.xml

and edit accordingly. The Stub latency is a parameter of the GLIB board and is enclosed in a <Register> xml node. Be aware that you have to set it for both front-ends. 

**This, in theory, is expert-only work as it could mess up the data.** 

Now you can configure the setup by typing (in the command line)

    configure -v "threshold in hex"

Since we will mostly be doing threshold scans, check in the elog & the measurement programm what threshold setting should be applied for this run and enter the value in hex, using the format "0xVV" where value stands for the number (8bit!) Be aware that the threshold is increased by lowering this number!

this last step will download all settings to the GLIB and the CBCs and read back the threshold. If you get an error message saying that it was not possible to read back a value in 5 iterations, try again.

Be carful not to alter any GLIB parameters as this could screw up running!

## Starting a Run on the GLIB DAQ

Head to the ELOG which is available from the beamtest web page:

    cmstkph2-bt.web.cern.ch

There create a new entry for your run with the correct information and submit it. Be carful to correctly fill all fields!

once the TLU / Telescope are running and waiting for our DAQ (particle counter going up but not the trigger counter), navigate to the GLIBStreamer application and start it by clicking start, which will start a run with the number of events you specified! You can stop it at any time by clicking "Stop"..

## Online monitoring the telescope data
The online monitor for the telescope data is running as part of the run control by default so take your time to look at the plots from time to time.
